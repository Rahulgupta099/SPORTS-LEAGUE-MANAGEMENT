    <h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 50px;">HOW TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">A volleyball game consists of two teams of six players each, separated by a net.
        <br> The six volleyball court positions are setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero and serving specialist.<br>
        To start, flip a coin to determine which team serves the ball first.<br>
        Then the two teams will rally—or hit the ball back and forth over the net—until a fault occurs. There is a maximum of three hits per side.<br>
        The objective is to score points by sending the ball over the net, grounding it into the opponent’s court.<br>
        Volleyball matches are made up of sets, typically three or five sets.<br>
        Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points. Each set must be won by two points.
        <br> The first team to win two sets is the winner of the match.<br>
        Five-set matches are four sets to 25 points and a fifth set to 15 points.
        <br> The team must win by two points unless tournament rules dictate otherwise. The first team to win three sets is the winner.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: none; padding-left: 70px;"><u>PLAYING RULES</u></h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 70px;">Here are the fundamental, must-know rules of a volleyball game:<br><br>
        <ol style="padding-left: 100px;">
            <li>Only 6 players on the floor at any given time: 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row.</li>
            <li>Points are made on every serve for the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).</li>
            <li>Players may not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a hit).</li>
            <li>Ball may be played off the net during a volley and on a serve.</li>
            <li>A ball hitting a boundary line is in.</li>
            <li>A ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floor completely outside the court,<br> any of the net or cables outside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the ceiling above a non-playable area.</li>
            <li>It is legal to contact the ball with any part of a player’s body.</li>
            <li>It is illegal to catch, hold or throw the ball.</li>
            <li>A player cannot block or attack a serve from on or inside the 10-foot line.</li>
            <li>After the serve, front-line players may switch positions at the net.</li>
            <li>Matches are made up of sets; the number depends on level of play.</ol></p>
